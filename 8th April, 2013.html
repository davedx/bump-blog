We can't wait to meet you

From Facebook, 14th March:

Today we listened to a new beat in the world, can't wait to meet him/her in October... such an incredible feeling hearing the heart beat of the latest addition to our family and seeing it on the ultrasound screen for the first time. We're having a baby :D

I'm a programmer, so I love any excuse to start a new project, preferably using the latest shiny new technology, but I've found that choosing or building something to write this stuff in is delaying me actually doing any writing. Today I decided I can't wait any longer, because I want to start this project, and writing down my thoughts and feelings on becoming a dad.

I hope that one day you'll be able to read this, and maybe it will give you a smile and a laugh here and there to see how it was for us, before and after you were born. My idea at the moment is to make some kind of cross between a scrapbook and a blog, a place for us to write down the story of the beginning of your life. Because photos are awesome, but it's even better if the stories behind the photos are also preserved.

So, what's the story?

We don't know exactly when you were conceived, just that it was around January sometime:

Wow....great news guys!!! We are both really happy for you!!! Doesn't end of October mean the baby was conceived at our wedding?!?!
-Steve Law (my step-sister Lucy's husband)

Yes, you may have been conceived at Lucy and Steve's wedding! Well, it was around the start of the year anyway. We were both quite nervous when we did the first pregnancy test, round at Debby and Gertjan's new house. It was snowing that day, very peaceful and quiet outside, but lots of thoughts and feelings going through our heads inside! Lara thought she could see something and showed the test result to Debby, who thought she saw something too, but it was *very* faint. It wasn't until the third test I think that we finally decided you were on your way!

We were still a bit nervous in the time before the first ultrasound, because the first part of a pregnancy is always the riskiest - generally, the longer it goes, the less chance there is something will go wrong. So imagine our relief, happiness and joy to see you on the big screen of the ultrasound at Sifra! That was the photo above, from the 14th March.

Last week we went for another ultrasound. Lara says these are normally quite brief, just a basic health check, so we were quite lucky when the nice lady gave us another good look at you. And this time you were well and truly awake! Legs a'kickin, arms a'wavin, and again the amazing sound of your heart, so tiny yet so strong and *there*, racing along steadily and surely. An announcement to the world. A new beat. Again we were overjoyed at seeing you.

At the weekend we went to Babydump and decided then and there which furniture to get for your room. It's called 'Provence' and we'll be getting it in June, before we go to Thailand with the boys. We also thought of a few more names for you -- we're not decided yet, and I won't even write anything down here either! Hopefully, we decided in time for you to have a name by the time you're reading this. :D

The boys are very excited to meet you. Rowan has already drawn several family pictures with all of us in it, his drawing is getting really good! So is Connor's - his latest was a pirate ship, I'm afraid you didn't feature in it, but I'm sure you'll love joining in the pirate games once you're old enough to steer the ship or climb the rigging. We talk about you a lot already -- they are already impatient to meet you -- and to be honest, so are we! 9 months is a long time to wait to meet the new member of your gezin. But wait we shall!

Until then!
